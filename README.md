# blockchain-on-mars
... 
After waiting for years and passing several tests, I was selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency (a fictitious organization) to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, I was chosen to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new colony. I decide to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency, named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
